            Generate is a product development studio at Northeastern that aims
            to unite tech minded individuals on campus, while also taking on
            semesterly clients to build out hardware products as part of their
            Build Studio.

            Their issue was that they had a very poor website that didn't really
            showcase what Generate was all about. I came on as their Web
            Designer and Developer to overhaul their site - which included their
            established brand. Their site was built on Wordpress theme they
            bought, and featured a very clunky data structure that made it hard
            to use.
